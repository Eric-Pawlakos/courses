glossary:
  "1st semester": the summer, in 2 parts
  "2nd semester": fall semester, likely 4 CS courses:
    - advanced programming or data structures (both taught by JWL)
      - NB: "AP" includes 'systems', 'networks'
    - prob/stats, either SIEO 3600 or SIEO 4150

math needed for 3rd semester:
  prob+stats
  calc I+II

skills needed for 2nd semester:
  io w/text files; text file processing
  unix environment or at least no "intimidation factor"
  control structures+iteration
    - for
    - while
  lists/'basic list structures'
  dictionaries in python
  basic programming, e.g., a 6-line nontrivial program
  representing information
    - e.g., binary #s
    - e.g., words
    - e.g., hash tables
  how is a computer 'built'?
    - von Neumann architecture
    - separation of primary and secondary memory
    - io devices in general
  what is the internet?
    - e.g., '5-layer version of the protocol stack'
    - e..g, IP addresses
    - e.g., the (post-hoc) taxonomy of the internet
  big O notation
  how to count operations
    - e.g., sorting
    - e.g., searching
    - e.g., why is binary search faster than linear search
    - e.g., 'how many searches of a phone book before sorting is good idea'
  {nb: do not need SQL}
