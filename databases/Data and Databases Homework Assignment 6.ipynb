Specifically, we're going to be working with the widgets listed on [this page](http://static.decontextualize.com/widgets.html). You'll be creating a MongoDB database that has a document for every listed widget. But first, in the cell below, connect to your local MongoDB instance and make a variable `collection` that points to a collection called `widgets` in the `lede_program` database. I've done the appropriate `import` statements for you, and included a line at the end that prints the full name of the collection (i.e., its database name plus the name of the collection.) The cell's output should be the string `lede_program.widgets`."

     "source": "Great! Now, the tough part. In the cell below, duplicate the code in the second code cell from Problem Set #2 in Assignment #5. There should be one key difference in your code, however: instead of creating an empty list, and adding each document to the list, you should instead *insert* each document into the `widgets` collection. After you've executed the code, evaluating the expression `list(collection.find())` should look something like this (your `ObjectId` numbers will be different):\n\n    [{u'_id': ObjectId('53b4c0c92735fe3ff2977816'),\n      u'partno': u'C1-9476',\n      u'price': 2.7,\n      u'quantity': 512,\n      u'widgetname': u'Skinner Widget'},\n     {u'_id': ObjectId('53b4c0c92735fe3ff2977817'),\n      u'partno': u'JDJ-32/V',\n      u'price': 9.36,\n      u'quantity': 967,\n      u'widgetname': u'Widget For Furtiveness'},\n      ... some widgets omitted for brevity ...\n     {u'_id': ObjectId('53b4c0c92735fe3ff297781e'),\n      u'partno': u'5B-941/F',\n      u'price': 13.26,\n      u'quantity': 919,\n      u'widgetname': u'Widget For Cinema'}]\n    \n(Hint: Pay attention to types! Make sure that `price` is an integer and `quantity` is a floating-point number when inserting the document into MongoDB.) I've included some scaffolding for you, including the Beautiful Soup import statement and the code to fetch the contents of `widgets.html` into a variable called `html_str`. I've also included, at the very end, the expression to show all documents in the collection."

You'll be pasting into the cell below a program that you've written elsewhere. (As discussed in class, it's difficult to run a Tornado application inside of iPython Notebook.)\n\nHere's how your web API should work. A request to the resource `/oz` should return the following response (as a JSON string):\n\n    {\"result\": \"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.\"}\n    \nIf the parameters `pet` and `place` are included in the query string, then the string in the response should include the strings specified as the values of those keys in place of `Toto` and `Kansas`, respectively. For example, the following request with `curl`, assuming your web service is running on `localhost` port `8000`...\n\n    curl -s \"http://localhost:8000/oz?pet=Fluffy&place=Brooklyn\"\n    \n... should print the following response:\n\n    {\"result\": \"Fluffy, I've a feeling we're not in Brooklyn anymore.\"}\n    \nI've included the basic framework for the application for you.
