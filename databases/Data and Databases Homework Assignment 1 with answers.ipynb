      "Your homework assignment takes the form of an IPython Notebook. To work on the assignment, you'll need to follow these steps: \n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledeprogram/courses/master/databases/Data%20and%20Databases%20Homework%20Assignment%201.ipynb) to download a copy of this file (with extension `.ipynb`).\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Upload the copy that you just got from the server to your own IPython Notebook server. Here's how to do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "(2a) First, make sure your IPython Notebook server is active (check the EC2 admin panel). Open a window to that server and make sure you're on the \"Notebooks\" screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2b) Find the `.ipynb` file that you just downloaded on your computer, open a window to your IPython Notebook server, and drag it into the file list.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2c) You've now got a copy of the assignment where you can work on it. Congratulations!\n",
      "\n",
      "(2d) Make sure to change the name of your copy of the homework assignment to include your own name (e.g., change it to \"Your Name - Data and Databases Homework Assignment 1\").\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) There are a number of problem sets below that require you to write code to achieve a goal. I've left code cells incomplete blank after each question. Your job is to fill in the code cells so that running the code produces the requested output. Make sure to use the \"Run\" command to ensure that your code works and gives accurate results. Feel free to insert Markdown cells if you have any notes or explanations regarding your code. You must complete all of the problem sets!\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) When you're done with your assignment, you need to submit it. Go to `File > Download as...` and click `IPython Notebook`. A `.ipynb` will be downloaded to your computer. E-mail that file as an attachment to `dbv2107@columbia.edu`. (We may change the procedure for submitting homework assignments in the future, as you become more familiar with Github.)\n",
