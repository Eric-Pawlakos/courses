      "#Dictionaries\n",
      "\n",
      "The dictionary is a very useful data structure in Python. The easiest way to conceptualize a dictionary is that it's like a list, except you don't look up values in a dictionary by their index in a sequence---you look them up using a \"key,\" or a unique identifier for that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to focus here just on learning how to get data *out* of dictionaries, not how to build new dictionaries from existing data. We're also going to omit some of the nitty-gritty details about how dictionaries work internally. You'll learn a lot of those details in later courses, but for now it means that some of what I'm going to tell you will seem weird and magical. Be prepared!\n",
      "\n",
      "##Why dictionaries?\n",
      "\n",
      "For our purposes, the benefit of having data that can be parsed into dictionaries, as opposed to lists, is that dictionary keys tend to be *mnemonic*. That is, a dictionary key will usually tell you something about what its value is. (This is in opposition to parsing, say, CSV data, where we have to keep counting fields in the header row and translating that to the index that we want.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Lists and dictionaries work together and are used extensively to represent all different kinds of data. Often, when we get data from a remote source, or when we choose how to represent data internally, we'll use both in tandem. The most common form this will take is representing a table, or a database, as a *list* of records that are themselves represented as *dictionaries* (mapping the name of the column to the value for that column). We'll see an example of this when we access the New York Times API, below.\n",
      "\n",
      "##What dictionaries look like\n",
      "\n",

You learned the basics of how to access a web API, and how to convert the \"raw data\" returned from such an API (in JSON format) to an actual Python data structure. You learned how to make URL query strings \"on the fly\" by constructing dictionaries with the desired keys and values. Finally, you put it all together and made a short program that does multiple API queries, combining the results from those queries into a dictionary. What will you accomplish next?!"
