###Foundations Homework - Wednesday, June 4

Find the function "len" on your machine. (For windows, look within SuperShell, Cygwin, Babun, etc.)

You can either use command line tools to seek it out, or else try to find it on the web.

Once you have found the file, try to read and parse it. How do you think this unfamiliar bit of code works?

####Due on Friday, June 6.
