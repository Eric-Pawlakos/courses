# Week 2

### Links

I put together an IPython notebook about [looping through a CSV](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ledeprogram/courses/blob/master/foundations/week_2/Looping%20through%20a%20CSV.ipynb) that *might* help out with some of those `row[0]` questions.

### Homework

You can find the **complete dogs.csv** at `http://jonathansoma.com/lede/dogs.csv`. Using that file, find out...

1. How many dogs are registered in New York City? *Hint: if you check out the IPython notebook above, it talks about how to convert the csv.reader variable into a list, which might give you an easy way to do it*
2. How many dogs are registered in Brooklyn? Staten Island? Queens? Manhattan? Bronx?
3. How many dogs are named Max in [Bed Stuy](http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Bedford-Stuyvesant-Brooklyn-NY.html)?
4. How many dogs have the color [brindle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brindle) as their first or second color?
5. How many dogs are named Max in the [Lower East Side](http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Lower-East-Side-New-York-NY.html)?
6. Ask the user for their name (you're gonna have to Google how to get user input in python!). Then find out how many dogs in New York have that name.
